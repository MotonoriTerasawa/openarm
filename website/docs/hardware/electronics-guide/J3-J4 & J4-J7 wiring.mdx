# J3-J4 and J4-J7 wiring

J3-J4 and J-J7 wirings are little tricky part. Please refer wiring topology as shown. Before start wiring, verify all connector's assignment.

## J3-J4 cable wiring

1. Plug J3 connector to J3 motor(upper arm) of J3-J4,and also J4 connector to J4 motor(elbow). All the cable goes backside of the upper arm.  
Due to the J4 connector is near by the chassis, so be careful not to damage your cable.

## J4-J7 wring

2. Plug J5 connector to J5 motor from back side of the arm, then bend elbow to stopping point and plug J4 connector to J4 motor. Make sure all wirings are coming from back side.

3. Plug J6 connector and J7 connector to J6 and J7 motor.  
J6 motor is little hard to plug in. Move the arm and find best position for this process.
